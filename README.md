### Tools
 - Python
 - Jupyter Notebook

## Project Purpose

This project displays an overview of the performance of all the machine learning models* used to asses and predict credit risk from the dataset provided, with the purpose of reducing financial risk for banks and financial institutions. In addition, using a supervised machine learning model can provide portfolio management for clients and recommendations in cases of fraud.


### Machine Learning Models (Algorithms)
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - Support Vector 

##  Analysis Results
Intial view of balance target values:

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
