![](https://github.com/MarielaKaradzhova/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/resources/cr.jpg)

### Tools
 - Python
 - Jupyter Notebook

## Project Purpose

This project displays an overview of the performance of all the machine learning models* used to asses and predict credit risk from the dataset provided, with the purpose of reducing financial risk for banks and financial institutions. In addition, using a supervised machine learning model can provide portfolio management for clients and recommendations in cases of fraud.


### Machine Learning Models (Algorithms)
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - Random Forest
 - support vector 

##  Analysis Results
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
